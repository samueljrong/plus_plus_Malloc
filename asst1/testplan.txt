Since for pervious workload, we only free pointers at the end of the allocate memory, which not good for test the merging of metablocks
So i used workload E to try freeing pointers with different order. And we can also compare the runtimes with workload A. 

Workload E
malloc(1) bytes store the pointer in array - do this 150 times.
then, freeing the pointer in the even index in the pointer array one by one. And then freeing the pointer in the odd index in the pointer array.
